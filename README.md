## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- Using Tailwind CSS for styling, including responsive design with flexbox utilities.
- Integrating custom fonts, such as the "Inter" font family, and managing font sizes and colors.
- Creating a responsive layout using Tailwind's utility classes.

```html
<!-- Example of Tailwind CSS classes -->
<div class="bg-darkgray flex justify-center items-center h-screen font-inter">
  <article
    class="mx-auto flex flex-col bg-darkgray justify-evenly items-center w-96 h-4/5 p-4 rounded-lg "
  >
    <!-- ... other HTML content ... -->
  </article>
</div>
```

## Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on:

- Enhancing my knowledge of Tailwind CSS and exploring more advanced features.
- Exploring additional ways to improve the accessibility and responsiveness of web applications.
- Incorporating JavaScript for interactive features and functionality.

## Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs): The official documentation for Tailwind CSS provided valuable guidance on class usage and customization.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): A source for adding custom fonts to the project, enhancing the visual appeal of the profile.
